Overview
========

This project is a culmination of scripts and plugins to help use gnome-keyring
as a single password store for various apps.

**Note:** Most of the plugins provided expect the bin/keyring script included
in the repository to be available in your path.

Dependencies:
  - gnome-keyring
  - python-gnomekeyring

bin/keyring
-----------

This script allows you to perform some basic operations on your keyring:

::

  Usage: keyring [options] <command> [command args]

  Commands:
    list - list all stored keys
    set [<key>] - set a key
    get/password <key> - get a password for the given key
    prompt - Open a dialog prompting for the key to use, then putting the
             resulting pass on the clipboard.
    delete <key> - delete the entry for the given key
    username <domain> - get the username for the given domain
    smtp - set a smtp password (msmtp format)
    link <key> <key> [<key> ...] - link one or more keys together
        Note that this is a feature unique to this script and
        won't be supported by other programs reading directly
        from gnome-keyring.

  Options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -k KEYRING, --keyring=KEYRING
                          the keyring to use (default: login)
    --hash=HASH           run the password through the specified hash before
                          outputting it
    --salt                combined with --hash, the key will be used as a salt
    --pbkdf2              use pbkdf2 with optional --hash and --salt to hash the
                          password for output
    -t TEMPFILE, --tempfile=TEMPFILE
                          write get/password/username to a tempfile (deleted 1s
                          after creation)
    -c, --clipboard       write get/password/username to a clipboard (cleared
                          10s after being set). Requires xclip
    -p, --paste           when used with 'prompt', paste the result password
                          into the currently focused field. Requires xdotool

vimperator
----------

A vimperator plugin is provided which can be used to populate username/password
fields on web site login forms by pulling the information from the keyring
based on the current domain.

To install this plugin simply add the absolute path to the keyring's vimperator
directory to your vimperator ``runtimepath`` in your ``~/.vimperatorrc`` file:

::

  set runtimepath+=/path/to/keyring/vimperator

After you've installed the plugin, the next step is to store your credentials
for a domain in the keyring using the format ``username@domain`` where username
can be an email address if necessary:

::

  ./bin/keyring set myuser@somesite.com
  ./bin/keyring set myuser@gmail.com@somesite.com

When deciding what domain to suffix the key with, please be aware that the
vimperator plugin will use the full domain name, but will strip off common
prefixes (www, www\\d*, wwws, us, login, sitekey, secure):

::

    www.site.com -> site.com
    www1.site.com -> site.com
    users.site.com -> users.site.com (no change)

Once you've added your credentials for a given site to the keyring, you can
then navigate to that site's login page and simply run ``:keyring login`` and the
username/password fields should be populated, allowing you to then manually
submit the form.

Note that the plugin will log some general debug info to the firebug console
allowing to get an idea of what is happening behind the scenes.

Here is a full usage for the ``:keyring`` command:

::

  Usage:
    :keyring login
       Attempt to find the username/password fields and populate them.
    :keyring username
       Populate the current (or last) focused input with the username.
    :keyring password
       Populate the current (or last) focused password input with the password.
       Note: this will only populate the input if it is of type 'password'.

pentadactyl
-----------

The pentadactyl plugin is just like the vimperator plugin, but you instead add
the keyring's pentadactyl directory the ``runtimepath`` in your
``~/.pentadactylrc`` file:

::

  set runtimepath+=/path/to/keyring/pentadactyl

irssi
-----

An irssi plugin is provided allowing you to authenticate all or individually
configured accounts using gnome-keyring.

You can install the plugin by copying or symlinking the
irssi/scripts/keyring.pl file to your irssi scripts directory
(~/.irssi/scripts) and then adding a corresponding load line to your irssi
startup file (~/.irssi/startup):

::

  load keyring.pl

After installing the keyring.pl plugin, you then need to create a ``login`` file
in your irssi config directory (~/.irssi/login) with a list of connection
commands, one per line, where the special ``<password>`` token is replaced with
the password obtained from the keyring.

Here is an example file to authenticate a freenode account and a google talk account:

::

  connect irc.freenode.net 6667 <password> mynick
  xmppconnect -host talk.google.com myuser@gmail.com <password>

Note that if the actual key used in the keyring for that account differs from
the username specified in the connection string, you can use the
``<password:key>`` syntax to specify the key to use when looking up the
password:

::

  xmppconnect -host talk.google.com myuser@gmail.com <password:myuser@gmail.com@irssi>


Once you've created the login file, you can then use the ``/keyring [username]``
command in irssi to authenticate all or individual accounts:

::

  /keyring
  /keyring username

Similar to using ``/names`` in a channel, supplying the special username
``names`` to ``/keyring`` will print a list of available usernames:

This feature can also be used with irssi's ``/set`` command if you have a
sensitive setting value. Any lines in your ``login`` file in the form of:

::

  set some_var <password>

Will use the variable name (``some_var`` in this example) as the keyring key to
lookup, and will substitute in the retrieved value to be set on that variable in
irssi.

::

  /keyring names


offlineimap
-----------

The keyring python module included at bin/keyring can also be used in
conjunction with offlineimap.

The first step is to set the ``pythonfile`` setting in your ~/.offlineimaprc
file:

::

  pythonfile = /path/to/keyring/bin/keyring

Then for each of your email repository configs in your ~/.offlineimaprc, you
can set the ``remotepasseval`` setting to pull the password from the keyring:

::

  remotepasseval = Keyring().get('me@domain.com')

msmtp
-----

When configured using ``--with-gnome-keyring``, msmtp supports pulling
credentials from gnome-keyring. The only caveat is that msmtp requires that the
credentials be stored in a very specific format in the keyring. To store keys in
the proper format, the bin/keyring script provides a dedicated ``smtp`` command
which will prompt you for the appropriate values:

::

  ./bin/keyring smtp

bash
----

A completion script is available to ease use from command line. Copy it in
/etc/bash_completion.d or source it to make completion available.

Others
------

For other programs the keyring script provides a ``prompt`` command which will
open a dialog (pygtk) where you can enter the key to use and the keyring script
will put the resulting password into your clipboard for 10 seconds during which
time you can paste it into the password field of whatever app you are using:

::

  ./bin/keyring prompt

If you would like the paste step to be performed for you, you can supply the
``--paste`` argument. Be careful though since this command cannot determine if the
currently focused input is a text field or not, so it would paste into a clear
text field exposing your password to anyone watching over your shoulder.

::

  ./bin/keyring prompt --paste

You can create a mapping to this command in your preferred window manager to
provide easy access to your keyring.
